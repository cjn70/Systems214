# Systems214 Description

-This course teaches students how to think about, build, debug, and test large computer programs. The course stresses learning how to use tools such as debuggers, profilers, source version control systems, and integrated development environments as an essential part of developing large programs. The course also stresses the understanding of how programs execute on today's computers and how to measure and optimize performance. Programming will be in C on Unix systems to introduce students to a new programming eco system, as well as enable the mapping of high-level language constructs to the underlying machine.

Topics: 
Systems programming in C and Unix:
- C programming
- Memory management and the C memory model
- System calls
- I/O
- Caching
- Multi-threaded programming
- Shell scripts
 
Software development:
- Performance (space and time) analysis and measurement
- Debugging
- Testing
- Performance optimization
 
Tools: 
- IDE (e.g., Eclipse)
- Source version control (e.g., CVS)
- Debugger (e.g., gdb)
- Memory errors (e.g., valgrind)
- Profiling (e.g., gprof, valgrind)
